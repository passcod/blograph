Preliminary notes

- Blograph does NOT handle minification. That task should be done
  either by a Rack Middleware, by a service higher on the HTTP reverse
  proxy chain on your server, or by an external service like Cloudflare.

- Blograph was created for the singular purpose of running my blog.

- Blograph does NOT read from tumblr.

- Blograph is the source of truth for the information it displays.

- Blograph handles more markup languages than I currently use.

- Blograph is not designed for static website generation, and thus
  cannot and should not be used to publish to Github Pages, Dropbox,
  or S3. Get a server or put it on Heroku or something.

- Blograph will read from a Git(Hub) repository.

- Blograph can and will show older versions of articles if that is so
  requested. If you do not want your typos or factual innacuracies to
  show up, use --amend and rebase.

- Blograph does not use SASS, LESS, Stylus, or other CSS preprocessors.
  If you think you can convince me otherwise, shoot me an email at
  blograph@passcod.name. If you do convince me, I will reply.

- Blograph uses YAML Front Matter.

- Blograph is dedicated to the Public Domain, see Creative Commons 0:
